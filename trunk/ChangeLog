   yaptest-issues.pl
   yaptest-parse-enum4linux.pl
   yaptest-parse-sslscan.pl (new script)
   yaptest-parse-dcetest.pl (new script)
  Note that support for "issues" is still quite rundentary
  in this release.  There are no issue descriptions, title,
  risk ratings, etc. yet.
* Semaphores implemented to solve race conidition which 
  caused postgres error message.
* Lots of database schema changes to support YaptestFE

2008-07-19 yaptest v0.1.4

* Nikto output filenames contain the protocol (http / https).
* Made some error messages more verbose.
* Can no longer accidentially add a network instead of an 
  IP via yaptest-hosts.pl (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24)

  hosts that complete their quick UDP scan in less than
  10 seconds (e.g. Windows boxes)
* yaptest-credentials.pl now allows searching on username
  and password fields using the special words NOTNULL and
  NOTEMPTY - useful to list accounts you know the password
  for
* Altered some database field names:
    icmp.type => icmp.icmp_type
    icmp.code => icmp.icmp_code

2008-05-15 yaptest v0.1.3

* Global settings (for all users) can now be configured in
  /etc/yaptest.conf - useful if lots of pentesters use a
  shared server.
* Lines in config files starting with # are treated as 
  comments.
* Included some example dictionaries.  These get installed
  in /usr/local/yaptest.  You want to replace these
  with some good dicts or select a different dict using
  /etc/yaptest.conf
* Created yaptest-db-ips-mac.sh for mac users.  It's basically
  the same as yaptest-db-ips.sh but doesn't run yapscan
  (yapscan doesn't work on mac)
* Changed usage of "yaptest-hosts.pl delete" to be like
  "yaptest-hosts.pl add".

  XML has been appended to an existing results file.

2008-05-12 yaptest v0.1.2

* yaptest-nmap-tcp.pl now parallelises scans - accidentally
  removed in previous version.

2008-04-20 yaptest v0.1.1

* command_log table created.  Each time yaptest runs an 
  external command, it will log the time the command is
  run to the command_log table.  End time is also recorded.
* API improvement.  Forked process can now communicate with
  backend database.  This was required for new logging 
  feature.
* yaptest-wizard.pl now reminds you to run yaptest-db-ips.sh.
* dns-grind, medusa, oscanner, snmpwalk added to dependency list.
* hoppy output now saved via -S option.  Hoppy v1.5+ required.
* yaptest-ldap.pl renamed to yaptest-ldapsearch.pl
* ldapsearch explicitly specifies -x for simple auth.  The 
  default on mac seems to be not to use simple auth.
* LDAP namingContexts stored in the port_info table.
* Added yaptest-port-info.pl for viewing information stored
  about each port.
* HTTP script now run against "nmap_service like http" instead
  of "nmap_service = http".  Proxy ports were being missed.
* Bug fix: A couple of scripts were still using perl -w.
  This breaks on linux where #!/usr/bin/env perl -w is used.
  Added "use warnings" instead.
* API improvement.  "OR" queries for port_info, e.g.
  nmap_service_name is "oracle" OR oracle_tns.  See
  yaptest-tnscmd.pl for an example.
* yaptest-bannergrab-ng.pl renamed to yaptest-bannergrab.pl
* Output from bannergrab now stored in the database.
* sslscan is now run against SMTP servers supporting
  STARTTLS.  sslscan v3.6+ required.
* smtp-user-enum.pl is run against SMTP servers which 
  bannergrab identifies has allowing user enumeration.
  Usernames are auto-parsed into credentials database.

2008-04-06 yaptest v0.1.0

* #!/usr/bin/perl changed to #!/usr/bin/env perl.
  This allows users to change to a different perl 
  interpreter just by changing their path.
* Cheers to deanx for the following bug reports / feature
  requests:
* Bug fix: -i option now works for "yaptest-hosts.pl query"
* Bug fix: yaptest.conf now quotes the env var, so yaptest
  still works when you have spaces in your path.
* yaptest_interface is now set to en0 by default on OSX
  and remains eth0 by default on Linux.  

2008-04-01 yaptest v0.0.9

* Added yaptest-issues.pl to keep track of which
  security issues are associated with which IPs / ports
* Added yaptest-oscanner.pl to run the Oracle password
  gussing script on all ports identified as Oracle by
  nmap.
* Added yaptest-dns-grind.pl to get DNS PTR hostnames
  for all IPs and store them in the database.
* yaptest-parse-arp-scan-local-network.pl now stores the
  NIC vendor as host-info (use yaptest-host-info.pl to
  query).
* yaptest-password-guess-ssh.pl now runs against all
  ports nmap identifies as ssh, not simply against port
  22.
* Added missing yaptest-parse-nbtscan.pl.  Oops.
* OSX users can install more easily using:
     make databasemac
     make installmac
* Debug messages removed from yaptest-progress.pl
* "make install" will check for PERL syntax errors while
  installing.  This is more to avoid bugs in releases
  than to help end users, though.

2008-03-31 yaptest v0.0.8

* Install scripts tweaked to be more compatible with OSX.
  Extra notes updated in the script comments.
* yaptest-nmap-tcp.pl can now be called on just the open
  port (as before) or on all IP addresses (new).  Nmap
  can therefore be used instead of yapscan.

2008-03-30 yaptest v0.0.7

* Interrupt tests and resume them later.
  run_test API now remembers what it has scanned and avoids
  re-scanning it.  This allows tests to be resumed 
  relatively efficiently if they're interrupted.
* Auto-parse scan results into the database.
  run_test API now has an option to specify a parser that
  will be run on on the output file.  These script now
  auto-parse, so the parsers aren't called from 
  yaptest-db-ips.sh:
        yaptest-yapscan-icmp.pl
        yaptest-yapscan-tcp.pl
        yaptest-rpcinfo.pl
        yaptest-onesixtyone.pl
        yaptest-enum4linux.pl
        yaptest-snmpwalk.pl
        yaptest-password-guess-ftp.pl
        yaptest-password-guess-mssql.pl
        yaptest-password-guess-rlogin.pl
        yaptest-password-guess-smb.pl
        yaptest-password-guess-ssh.pl
        yaptest-arp-scan-local-network.pl
* Added yaptest-host-info.pl.  This can be used to store 
  arbitrary info about a host in key/value format.  Currently
  used for tracking OS, Windows domain, Domain controllers,
  Device type, SNMP system description.
* "make checkdep" is now supported to check for missing 
  external programs and PERL modules.
* yaptest-yapscan-tcp.pl now breaks scans into chunks and
  run scans on custom port ranges.  The smaller chunks help
  to resume scans more efficiently.
* Added yaptest-password-guess-mysql.pl to guess passwords 
  against any mysql servers found.
* Most password guessing is not turned off in 
  yaptest-db-ips.sh to avoid locking accounts out.
* yaptest-enum4linux.pl now uses version 0.8.0 which takes
  different command line args and does more thorough enumeration.
* yaptest-groups.pl can now parse group info from enum4linux
  output.  This is incredibly helpful when attacking large
  Windows domains.
* yaptest-ports.pl now support querying of ports based on
  nmap version string (e.g. 'Apache').
* yaptest-parse-onesixtyone.pl now stores system descrition
  as "host-info" and recognises jetdirect systems as having
  device_type = printer.
* rpcinfo-based tests use RPC number instead of name incase 
  users don't have a good /etc/rpc file.
* Optimised yaptest-db-ips.sh to do the interesting stuff
  first.
* Nmap TCP scans use --version-all so nmap does a better job
  of identifying strange ports.  This is slower, but is 
  important because so many scripts rely on what nmap finds.
* Lots of schema enhancements to support current and future
  features.
* yaptest-parse-nbtscan.pl added to store hostname,
  domain membership and domain controller info in backend
  database.
* Added ASCII art to yaptest-wizard.pl :-)

2007-12-22 yaptest v0.0.6

* Added yaptest-groups.pl to keep track of group memberships
  for Unix system.  No Windows support yet, though.
* Added yaptest-bannergrab-ng.pl which runs bannergrab-ng on 
  every TCP port.
* Added yaptest-sslscan.pl which runs sslscan on all the 
  TCP ports which nmap thinks are SSL ports.
* Added yaptest-httprint.pl which runs httprint on all
  HTTP and HTTPS ports.
* Added yaptest-hoppy.pl which runs hoppy on all
  HTTP and HTTPS ports.
* Fixed bug in yaptest-wizard.pl.  It was creating test areas
  as subdirs other test areas.
* Fixed bug which prevented proper parsing of NTLM hashes from
  the john.pot file.
* Added support for cracking NTLM hashes using NTLM rainbow 
  tables via rcrack.  See yaptest-credentials.pl for details.
* Bug fix: yaptest-parse-hydra.pl can now deal with blank passwords

2007-11-03 yaptest v0.0.5

* Added rcrack support for cracking LANMAN hashes to 
  yaptest-credentials.pl.
* Added test-setup script yaptest-wizard.pl
* Significant speed-ups for database performance while password 
  cracking.  It can still be slow, but now usable for ~3000 accounts.
* Support for cracking NTLM hashes with john the ripper.
* Support for specifying a john command line.  Edit yaptest.conf.
  Useful for using a copy that is not in the path or starting
  the MPI version of john with mpiexec.
* Enum4linux now cycles through more RIDs to try and avoid missing
  accounts.
* Yaptest-hosts.pl can add a list of hosts from the command
  line - instead of one at a time like before.
* Yaptest-hosts.pl can delete hosts.

2007-07-29 yaptest v0.0.4

* Generally cleaned up output to remove debug messages and 
  standardise usage messages.
* yaptest-parse-snmpwalk.pl added.  Parses usernames from Windows
  systems into the credentials database.  Also parses unix users
  from process listing.
* yaptest-parse-enum4linux.pl added.  Parses username info if 
  target has settings equivelant to RestrictAnonymous=0 or 1.
* yaptest-parse-hydra.pl added.  Guessed usernames and passwords
  are now added to credentials database by yaptest-db-ips.sh.
  Use "yaptest-credentials.pl query" for list of creds found.
* yaptest-ports.pl can now search on nmap service type and nmap
  service version so you can easily search for all HTTP servers
  or all Apache servers for example.
* yaptest-icmp.pl added for querying which hosts respond to ICMP.
* yaptest-password-guess-smb.pl now uses hydra instead 
  of medusa.
* Bug fix: SNMP community strings are now displayed by
           yaptest-credentials.pl, and used properly by
	   yaptest-snmpwalk.pl
* Bug fix: Uniquness constraint when parsing slightly different
           nmap results.
* Mostly removed support for environment variable in favour of
  yaptest.conf and ~/.yaptestrc configuration files.
* Added yaptest-config.pl

2007-07-15 yaptest v0.0.3
